Changelog:
v0.9.14
- Added Claude Opus 4.8
- Promt caching bugfixes when using native PDF Upload and Images

v0.9.13
- Token counting is now Claude-Code-style: `total_tokens` only counts NEW tokens (uncached input + cache_creation + output) instead of all tokens
- Added `ENABLE_CACHE_DIAGNOSTICS` valve for debug purposes

v0.9.12
- Refactored the pipe into modular source files under `src/anthropic_pipe/`.
- Extracted request payload creation into `request_payload.py` for cache/debug work.
- Split streaming content-block handling into per-content modules and added a build step that compiles/minifies the OpenWebUI single-file artifact before deploy.
- Fixed Anthropic API Skills container payload shape and added clearer Files API / code execution guidance.

v0.9.11
- Added async handling for run_command <-> bash tool
- Added all anthropic server tools as TOOL_SEARCH_EXCLUDE_TOOLS

v0.9.10
- Added Experimental path for using Anthropics native (`bash_20250124`) to use with OpenTerminal. Use Valve `ENABLE_BASH_TOOL`
- Added Experimental path for using Anthripics native (`text_editor_20250728` / `str_replace_based_edit_tool`) tools to use with Open Terminal. Use Valve `ENABLE_TEXT_EDITOR_TOOL`.

v0.9.9
- Fixed Tool Search Block reconstruction as well. Displays collapsible instead of status
- Added Experimental support for the Advisor tool support (beta `advisor-tool-2026-03-01`). New valves:
  `ENABLE_ADVISOR_TOOL`, `ADVISOR_MODEL` (default claude-opus-4-7),
  `ADVISOR_MAX_USES` (0=unlimited), `ADVISOR_CACHING` (off/5m/1h ephemeral).

v0.9.8
- Complete overhaul of how message blocks are recreated for a new turn to align with
    Anthropic cache restrictions.
- Cache now should not break on new turns even when using RAG, image or PDF upload,
    memory, tools, and similar flows.
- Refactored tool / thinking output so grouped activity renders as one collapsible UI block.

v0.9.7
- Preserves thinking signatures across turns for better replay continuity and cache behavior.

v0.9.6
- Updated for Open WebUI 0.9.0+ async APIs.

v0.9.5

v0.9.3
- Moved Compaction and Context Editing into UserValves.

- Tool Input and Code Execution Input is not correctly streamed in a collapsible container with spinner
- Removed Status Update for Tool Calls and Code Execution as they are now streaming live with the new streaming strategy
- Tool Call Errors get's correctly emitted now instead of silently ignored and causing unlimited spinning

  - Auto-retries up to MAX_RETRIES times with clean state reset
  - Shows user-visible status during retry and error message if all retries fail
  - Root cause: Anthropic API overload (529) → SDK retry → 200 OK but truncated stream

- All server tool errors (web_search, web_fetch, code_execution, bash, text_editor) now emit user-visible error messages

v0.8.4

# NOTE: Thinking blocks must NEVER be removed from assistant messages!
# Per Anthropic API docs:
# - During tool use loops: thinking blocks MUST be preserved unmodified in assistant content
# - Multi-turn: thinking blocks from prior turns CAN be omitted (API filters them),
#   but preserving them is preferred
# - The entire sequence of consecutive thinking blocks must match the original model output
# - signature field is critical and must be preserved exactly
# - Interleaved thinking (Claude 4): thinking blocks can appear BETWEEN tool calls
