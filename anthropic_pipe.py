Changelog:
v0.9.11
- Added async handling for run_command <-> bash tool
- Added all anthropic server tools as TOOL_SEARCH_EXCLUDE_TOOLS

v0.9.10
- Added Experimental path for using Anthropics native (`bash_20250124`) to use with OpenTerminal. Use Valve `ENABLE_BASH_TOOL`
- Added Experimental path for using Anthripics native (`text_editor_20250728` / `str_replace_based_edit_tool`) tools to use with Open Terminal. Use Valve `ENABLE_TEXT_EDITOR_TOOL`.

v0.9.9
- Fixed Tool Search Block reconstruction as well. Displays collapsible instead of status
- Added Experimental support for the Advisor tool support (beta `advisor-tool-2026-03-01`). New valves:
  `ENABLE_ADVISOR_TOOL`, `ADVISOR_MODEL` (default claude-opus-4-7),
  `ADVISOR_MAX_USES` (0=unlimited), `ADVISOR_CACHING` (off/5m/1h ephemeral).

v0.9.8
- Added correct handling of Server Tool Blocks as well (web_search, web_fetch, code_execution family) are now persisted as
  hidden carriers (`<details type="tool_calls" data-block-kind="server_tool_use|server_tool_result"
  data-payload-b64="...">`) 
- web_search / web_fetch now render ONE merged collapsible per call instead of two adjacent
  blocks. The `server_tool_use` carrier is updated in-place via `replace` event when the
  matching `*_tool_result` arrives, embedding both payloads (`data-payload-b64` +
  `data-result-payload-b64`). Replay decodes both into separate API blocks at the original
  position so tool_use + tool_result ordering is preserved.
- Removed redundant status events ("🔍 Searching for: …", "🌐 Fetching: …", "Found X results
  - … +N more", "🌐 URL fetched", error variants). All info now lives inside the collapsible
  body so it stays inline with the conversation flow and never leaks back to the API
  (status text is body-only; replay only consumes base64 payloads).
- A lot of cleanup

v0.9.7
- Persist thinking block signatures across turns. `<details type="reasoning">`
  blocks now carry a `data-signature` HTML attribute carrying the opaque
  server-issued signature, and historical reasoning blocks are reconstructed
  as structured {type:"thinking", thinking, signature} API blocks on replay.
  This enables Opus 4.5+/Sonnet 4.6/Mythos thinking-preservation cache hits
  and keeps reasoning continuity intact across multi-turn conversations.
  Unsignatured legacy blocks are silently dropped (API would strip them
  anyway on non-tool-result turns).

v0.9.6
- open-webui 0.9.0+ compatibility update (async DB API)
- fixed token counting for analytics tab
- Fixed tool-call history loss (GitHub issue #30): historical assistant messages with
  <details type="tool_calls"> HTML are now parsed back into structured tool_use/tool_result
  blocks instead of being stripped. Claude no longer loses evidence of prior tool calls
  on follow-up turns and stops re-executing tools wastefully. Interrupted (done="false")
  calls synthesize is_error tool_results to keep the chain valid.

v0.9.5
- Added Opus 4.7
- Added new "xhigh" effort level (Opus 4.7 only)
- Effort values are now clamped per-model: xhigh -> high on non-Opus-4.7, max -> high on models that don't support it

v0.9.4
- Added Cache Statistics to Token Count Message

v0.9.3
- Moved compaction and context editing valves to UserValves
- SHOW_TOKEN_COUNT valve upgraded from bool to "Off"/"On"/"With Cache" — "With Cache" shows cache read/write tokens and TTL

v0.9.2
- added compaction and client-side compaction trim: drops messages before the last compaction boundary before sending
and added message trim optimization

v0.9.1
- return whole message at the end and switched from chat:completion to message:delta event to prevent empty messages

v0.9
- Fixed total_usage access bug when usage capability is not enabled on model
- Removed Sonnet 4 and Opus/Sonnet 4.5 from 1 Mio context windows support
- Fetch model capabilites like max_input_token now directly from the API
- Added support for thinking.display: "omitted" (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking#controlling-thinking-display)

v0.8.12

- Added Valves for Request and Tool call Timeouts

- Added optional API Key set via UserValves (overrides header-level key)
- Reintroduced the Ability for Claude to know how many tool calls are available until limit is hit
- Removed 1 Mio Context Window Valve as it's now generally available

v0.8.8
- Fixed a Bug with interleaved thinking and tool calls where the API does not preserve the thinking blocks resulting in invalid requests
- Tool Input and Code Execution Input is not correctly streamed in a collapsible container with spinner
- Removed Status Update for Tool Calls and Code Execution as they are now streaming live with the new streaming strategy
- Tool Call Errors get's correctly emitted now instead of silently ignored and causing unlimited spinning

v0.8.7
- Code execution blocks now use OpenWebUI native `<details type="code_interpreter">` format
  - Spinner + "Analyzing…" / "Analyzed" transitions matching built-in code interpreter
  - Duration tracking and display
  - Output (stdout, stderr, tool call results) in HTML `output` attribute for CodeBlock rendering
- Fixed live-streamed code blocks getting stuck on "Analyzing…" when new code_execution starts
- Fixed empty "Analyzed" blocks by using accumulated code as fallback
- Removed redundant status events for code execution ("Running code", "Code → Tool", "Code execution complete")
- Fixed cache_control being placed on programmatic tool_use blocks with caller field

  - Detects when API returns thinking/server_tool blocks but no text and no stop_reason
  - Auto-retries up to MAX_RETRIES times with clean state reset
  - Shows user-visible status during retry and error message if all retries fail
  - Root cause: Anthropic API overload (529) → SDK retry → 200 OK but truncated stream
- Fixed: JSON.parse frontend error caused by pipe returning dict {} instead of empty string
  - functions.py sent `data: {}` without [DONE] → frontend failed to parse as OpenAI chunk
  - Now returns "" → proper finish_reason=stop + [DONE] SSE termination

v0.8.5
- Refactored: Cache control logic consolidated into single `_apply_cache_control()` method
  - All scattered cache_control placement removed from `_create_payload()` and tool loop

  - Bug fix: Tools now cached at all non-disabled levels (was missing at "messages" level)
  - Tool loop: properly handles programmatic vs standard tool calling cache placement

- Fixed: code_execution_tool_result missing explicit error_code check
- All server tool errors (web_search, web_fetch, code_execution, bash, text_editor) now emit user-visible error messages

v0.8.4
- Fixed: Streaming overloaded_error (HTTP 200 + SSE error) now retries instead of failing immediately (GH #19)
- Fixed: Non-streaming OverloadedError (529) was falling through to generic APIStatusError handler instead of retrying

# COMPILED REGEX PATTERNS
# Pre-compiled patterns for performance - avoids re-compiling on every call
# =============================================================================

# NOTE: Thinking blocks must NEVER be removed from assistant messages!
# Per Anthropic API docs:
# - During tool use loops: thinking blocks MUST be preserved unmodified in assistant content
# - Multi-turn: thinking blocks from prior turns CAN be omitted (API filters them),
#   but preserving them is preferred
# - The entire sequence of consecutive thinking blocks must match the original model output
# - signature field is critical and must be preserved exactly
# - Interleaved thinking (Claude 4): thinking blocks can appear BETWEEN tool calls
# Previously PATTERN_THINKING_BLOCK was defined here but never used - removed as dead code.
